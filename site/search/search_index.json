Here's a simple example to understand it better:</p> <p>Imagine you have a smart assistant that can write answers to your questions. Sometimes, this assistant might not know everything it needs to give a great answer. To help with this, RAG lets the assistant look up information from a large collection of documents, videos, images similar to how you might search the internet for answers. After finding the relevant information, the assistant then uses this data to write a better, more accurate response.</p> <p>So, RAG combines two steps:</p> <ul> <li>Retrieval: Finding relevant information from a big pool of data.</li> <li>Generation: Using that information to create a detailed and accurate response.</li> </ul> <p>This way, RAG helps in providing more informed and useful answers, making it very effective for tasks like answering questions, writing articles, and assisting with research.</p> <p>In the previous exercise, you learned how to create a custom engine copilot and customize the prompt for defining the behavior of the AI chatbot, Career Genie. In this exercise, you'll apply vector search to a collection of resumes to find the best candidate for the job requirements. To enable vector search in Career Genie, you'll use the \"Azure OpenAI Studio on your data\" feature to:</p> <ul> <li>Create an index on Azure AI Search.</li> <li>Generate vector embeddings for the resumes (PDF documents).</li> <li>Upload the data in chunks to Azure AI Search.</li> </ul> <p>Finally, you'll integrate your custom engine copilot with Azure AI Search to chat with your data and obtain the best results.</p> <p>Benefits of using Vector Search</p> <p>Vector search is an advanced technique used to find information quickly and accurately based on its meaning rather than just matching exact words. Unlike traditional text-based search, which relies on exact keyword matches, vector search uses numeric vectors to find content that is similar to your query. This enables Vector search to handle:</p> <ul> <li>Semantic or conceptual similarity: Matching concepts that are similar in meaning even if they use different words (e.g., \"pastry\" and \"croissant\").</li> <li>Multilingual content: Finding equivalent content across different languages (e.g., \"pastry\" in English and \"geb\u00e4ck\" in German).</li> <li>Multiple content types: Searching across different formats (e.g., \"pastry\" in text and an image of a pastry).</li> </ul> <p>Here is how vector search works:</p> <ol> <li>Converting text to vectors: Imagine turning words or sentences into a series of numbers (a vector) that captures the essence or meaning of that text. This is done using techniques like word embeddings or deep learning models.</li> <li>Storing vectors: These vectors are stored in a special database designed to handle them efficiently.</li> <li>Searching with vectors: When you search for something, your query is also converted into a vector. The search system then looks for vectors in the database that are close to your query vector in terms of meaning, not just exact word matches.</li> </ol> <p>For example, if you search for \"how to bake a cake\" the system can find documents about \"cake recipes\" or \"baking tips\" even if they don't have the exact words \"how to bake a cake\" or even if the recipes are written in another language. This makes vector search powerful for finding relevant information based on context and meaning, especially in large datasets.</p> <p>In summary, vector search improves the search process by focusing on the meaning behind the words, enabling more accurate and relevant results.</p>"},{"location":"pages/custom-engine/02-rag/#exercise-1-setup-azure-resources","title":"Exercise 1: Setup Azure Resources","text":"<p>You'll need to complete the Azure subscription pre-requisite before starting with this exercise.</p>"},{"location":"pages/custom-engine/02-rag/#step-1-create-azure-ai-search-service-resource","title":"Step 1: Create Azure AI Search service resource","text":"What is Azure AI Search? <p>Azure AI Search (formerly known as \"Azure Cognitive Search\") provides secure information retrieval at scale over user-owned content in traditional and generative AI search applications.When you create a search service, you work with the following capabilities:</p> <ul> <li>A search engine for vector search, full text and hybrid search over a search index</li> <li>Rich indexing with integrated data chunking and vectorization</li> <li>Rich query syntax for vector queries, text search, hybrid queries</li> <li>Integration with Azure AI services and Azure OpenAI</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Open the browser of your choice and navigate to Azure Portal.</li> <li>Select Create a resource, then search for <code>Azure AI Search</code>.
